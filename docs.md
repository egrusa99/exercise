This documentation describes how to use the Pavel automated toothbrush for the first time. But anyone needs a refresher.

Note that this toothbrush is totally safe to use for children, adults, pets, and wildlife, especially orcas!!

Time to save the work that should disappear. This line is really good!

The toothbrush requires batteries.

No warranty is implied.
